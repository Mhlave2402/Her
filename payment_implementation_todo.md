# Refined Payment Flow Implementation Tasks

## Backend (Laravel)
- [x] Database Migrations
  - [x] payment_gateways table (name, status, priority, test/live keys, mode)
  - [x] saved_cards table (user_id, masked_card_number, token, expiry, default_flag)
- [x] PaymentGateway Interface
  - [x] chargeCard(), saveCard(), initiate3DS(), verify3DS()
  - [x] Mask actual gateway (Stripe/Paystack) → all responses normalized
- [x] PaymentService
  - [x] Unified entry point → routes requests to correct gateway
  - [x] Handles wallet top-ups and direct payments
  - [x] Logs all transactions securely
- [x] Controllers
  - [x] PaymentController → initiate payments
  - [x] Payment3DSController → handle 3DS callbacks/redirects
  - [x] PaymentRecordController → updated to use new service
- [x] Admin Gateway Config
  - [x] UI for enable/disable, set priority, switch test/live mode
  - [x] Store API keys securely in env or encrypted DB

## Frontend (Flutter)
- [x] CardPaymentScreen
  - [x] Custom UI (no gateway branding)
  - [x] Option to save card (checkbox toggle)
  - [x] Shows supported card types (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
- [x] ThreeDSAuthenticationScreen
  - [x] Redirect-based for MVP
  - [ ] Embedded iframe optional for v2
- [x] SavedCardsWidget
  - [x] List user's saved cards (masked numbers)
  - [x] Default card selection
  - [x] Remove/edit card option
- [x] Transaction History
  - [x] Show branded messages (your company name, not Stripe/Paystack)
  - [x] Show icons for payment type (wallet, card, gift card)
- [x] UI Enhancements
  - [x] Smooth animations on card entry
  - [x] Proper error messages (e.g., "Card declined" instead of raw gateway errors)

## Testing & Compliance
- [ ] Unit + integration tests for payment service & controllers
- [ ] End-to-end tests for card payment + 3DS flow
- [ ] PCI compliance verification (esp. if handling card details directly)
- [ ] Load/stress test transactions under scale
- [ ] Security audit (focus on tokenization, card storage, env key handling)

## Additional Features (Optional in MVP)
- [x] Wallet Top-Up
  - [x] Via card or gift card
  - [x] Wallet balance integrated into payment flow
- [x] Branded Confirmations
  - [x] Email/SMS/Push notifications using your company name
- [x] Admin Dashboard
  - [x] Manage gateways
  - [x] Manage transactions, and failed payments
  - [x] Reporting & analytics
