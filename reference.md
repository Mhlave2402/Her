# Project State and Next Steps

This document outlines the work completed so far and the remaining tasks for fixing the compilation errors in the Flutter project.

## Summary of Work Completed

1.  **Initial Fixes:**
    *   Checked for the typo `bnmjimport` in `lib/features/home/widgets/pay_shortfall_widget.dart`. The typo was not present.
    *   Removed Git conflict markers from `lib/features/set_destination/screens/set_destination_screen.dart`.
    *   Verified that the import order in `test/widget_test.dart` was correct.
    *   Created placeholder files for `lib/features/parcel/widgets/finding_rider_widget.dart` and `lib/features/set_destination/models/estimated_fare_model.dart`.

2.  **Addressing New Compilation Errors:**
    *   A large number of compilation errors were identified after the initial fixes.
    *   The most common error was `The method 'showCustomSnackBar' isn't defined`.
    *   It was discovered that the function was renamed to `customSnackBar` in `lib/common_widgets/custom_snackbar.dart`.
    *   The `customPrint` function was replaced with `debugPrint` in `lib/data/api_client.dart`.

3.  **Files Updated to use `customSnackBar`:**
    *   `lib/features/ride/controllers/ride_controller.dart`
    *   `lib/features/payment/controllers/payment_controller.dart`
    *   `lib/features/location/view/pick_map_screen.dart`
    *   `lib/features/auth/screens/sign_in_screen.dart`
    *   `lib/features/refund_request/controllers/refund_request_controller.dart`
    *   `lib/features/safety_setup/controllers/safety_alert_controller.dart`
    *   `lib/features/auth/controllers/auth_controller.dart`
    *   `lib/features/auth/screens/otp_log_in_screen.dart`
    *   `lib/features/auth/screens/forgot_password_screen.dart`
    *   `lib/features/auth/screens/sign_up_screen.dart`
    *   `lib/features/payment/screens/payment_screen.dart`
    *   `lib/features/auth/screens/reset_password_screen.dart`
    *   `lib/features/auth/screens/verification_screen.dart`
    *   `lib/features/giftcard/controllers/gift_card_controller.dart`
    *   `lib/features/coupon/widget/offer_coupon_card_widget.dart`
    *   `lib/features/parcel/widgets/parcel_details_input_view.dart`
    *   `lib/features/ride/widgets/rise_fare_widget.dart`
    *   `lib/features/ride/widgets/trip_fare_summery.dart`
    *   `lib/features/map/widget/initial_widget.dart`
    *   `lib/features/profile/widgets/edit_profile_account_info.dart`
    *   `lib/features/address/screens/add_new_address.dart`
    *   `lib/features/address/controllers/address_controller.dart`

## Next Steps

The immediate next step is to continue replacing all instances of `showCustomSnackBar` with `customSnackBar` and adding the required import: `import 'package:shego_user_app/common_widgets/custom_snackbar.dart';`.

### Files to check for `showCustomSnackBar`:
- `lib/features/message/controllers/message_controller.dart`
- `lib/features/refer_and_earn/screens/referral_details_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/wallet/controllers/wallet_controller.dart`
- `lib/features/set_destination/widget/process_button_widget.dart`
- `lib/features/parcel/widgets/parcel_info_widget.dart`
- `lib/features/refund_request/screens/refund_request_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/trip/widgets/parcel_details_widget.dart`
- `lib/features/message/screens/message_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/wallet/widget/wallet_money_amount_widget.dart`
- `lib/features/wallet/widget/transfer_money_dialog_widget.dart`
- `lib/features/wallet/widget/point_to_wallet_money_widget.dart`

After fixing all `showCustomSnackBar` errors, the remaining compilation errors from the feedback list will need to be addressed.
