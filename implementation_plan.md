# Implementation Plan

[Overview]
This plan outlines the redesign of the Wallet Money screen to create a modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing interface.

The current implementation of the Wallet Money screen is basic and lacks the modern design elements specified in the requirements. This redesign will introduce a new wallet card, top-up options, and a top-up history section. The goal is to improve the user experience by making the screen more intuitive and visually engaging.

[Types]
No new types will be introduced.

[Files]
This implementation will involve modifying one existing file and creating four new files.

- **Modified Files:**
  - `Shego user app/lib/features/wallet/widget/wallet_money_screen.dart`: This file will be updated to incorporate the new widgets and layout.
- **New Files:**
  - `Shego user app/lib/features/wallet/widget/wallet_card_widget.dart`: This file will contain the new wallet card widget.
  - `Shego user app/lib/features/wallet/widget/top_up_button_widget.dart`: This file will contain the new top-up button widget.
  - `Shego user app/lib/features/wallet/widget/top_up_history_item_widget.dart`: This file will contain the new top-up history item widget.
  - `Shego user app/lib/features/wallet/widget/top_up_history_widget.dart`: This file will contain the new top-up history section.

[Functions]
No new functions will be introduced.

[Classes]
This implementation will introduce four new classes.

- **New Classes:**
  - `WalletCardWidget`: Located in `Shego user app/lib/features/wallet/widget/wallet_card_widget.dart`, this class will display the wallet card with the wallet name, balance, and user name.
  - `TopUpButtonWidget`: Located in `Shego user app/lib/features/wallet/widget/top_up_button_widget.dart`, this class will display the top-up buttons with an icon and a label.
  - `TopUpHistoryItemWidget`: Located in `Shego user app/lib/features/wallet/widget/top_up_history_item_widget.dart`, this class will display a single top-up history item with the amount, date, and method.
  - `TopUpHistoryWidget`: Located in `Shego user app/lib/features/wallet/widget/top_up_history_widget.dart`, this class will display the top-up history section with a list of top-up history items.

[Dependencies]
No new dependencies will be introduced.

[Testing]
This implementation will not involve any testing.
